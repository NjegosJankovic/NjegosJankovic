👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Njegos Jankovic, a researcher in the field of power systems stability.

:electric_plug: :heavy_plus_sign: :battery: My focus is on the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, development of control algorithms for renewable energy sources, and provision of ancillary grid-support services by those sources.

💡 I'm working on solving the challenges faced by power systems, such as low-frequency oscillations, low-inertia, and voltage instabilities. My focus is on developing algorithms for renewable energy sources to provide power oscillation damping, virtual inertia, and grid-voltage support services.

🌍 I'm interested in making a power system reliable, so it can provide energy to meet the demands of our modern world.
